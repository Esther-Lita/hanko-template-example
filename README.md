# Hanko and Next.js Example

This shows how to use [Hanko.io](https://www.hanko.io/) with Next.js. This example is already implementing the login, profile management and the user logout to your Next.js aplication.

## How to use

Execute `create-next-app` to bootstrap the example

```bash
npx create-next-app --example [Github Repository Link] <YOUR_APP_NAME>
```

Example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/Esther-Lita/hanko-template-example next-with-hanko
```

To run the example locally you need to:

1. Sign up at [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io/login)
2. Go to the dashboard and create a project.
3. Create the `.env` file and set the required Hanko environment variables from your Hanko project.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
